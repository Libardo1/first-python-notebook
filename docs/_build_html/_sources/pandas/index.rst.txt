Chapter 2: Hello pandas
=======================

Lucky for us, Python is filled with functions to do pretty much anything youâ€™d ever want to do with a programming language: `navigate the web <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_, `parse data <https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html>`_, `interact with a database <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_, `run fancy statistics <https://www.scipy.org/>`_, `build a pretty website <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and `so <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_ `much <http://www.nltk.org/>`_ `more <http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/index.html>`_. Creative people have put these tools to work to get `a wide range of things done <https://www.python.org/about/success/>`_ in the arts, technology and even outer space.

Some of those tools are included in a toolbox that comes with the language, known as the standard library. Others have been built by members of Python's developer community and need to be downloaded and installed from the web.

For this exercise, we're going to install and use `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, a tool developed at a financial investment firm that has become a leading open-source tool for accessing and analyzing data.

We'll install pandas the same way we installed the Jupyter Notebook earlier: Our friend ``pip``. Save your notebook, switch to your command prompt and hit ``CTRL-C``. That will kill your notebook and return you to the command line. There we'll install pandas.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install pandas

Now let's restart our notebook and get back to work.

.. code-block:: python

    jupyter notebook

Use the next open notebook cell to import the pandas library for use in our script. Type in the following and hit the play button again.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas

.. image:: /_static/import_pandas.png

If nothing happens, that's good. It means you have pandas installed and ready to work.

If you get an error message, return to the prequisites section above and make sure you have everything installed properly. If you do and it still doesn't work, copy and paste the tail end of your error message into Google. Among the results there will almost certainly be others working through the same problem.

.. note::

    As we continue through the lesson you should assume all of the code we write is in a new cell run separately from the previous line.

    Breaking up your code like this so you can run it bit by bit is one of the big advantages of the Jupyter Notebook. If you get an error after you run a cell, look carefully at your code and see that it exactly matches what's been written in the example.

    Once they match, try running it again. Don't worry, that kind of feedback loop is the workaday struggle of computer programming.

Now that we've got ``pandas`` loaded, let's put it to work.

Until last November, the use and sale of marijuana for recreational purposes was illegal in California. That changed when voters approved Proposition 64, which asked voters if the practice ought to be legalized. A yes vote supported legalization. A no vote opposed it. `In the final tally <http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2016-general/sov/65-ballot-measures-formatted.pdf>`_, 57% of voters said yes.

Your mission, `should you choose to accept it <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TiqXFssKMY>`_, is to analyze lists of campaign committees and contributors to figure out the biggest donors both for and against the measure.

To start `click here <http://first-python-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/prop-committees.csv>`_ to download a list of last November's 17 ballot measures and their affiliated fundraising committees.

The data are structured in rows of comma-separated values. This is known as a CSV file. It is the most common way you will find data published online. Save the file with the name ``prop-committees.csv`` in the same directory where you made your notebook.

Open the file in your notebook using the `read_csv <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html>`_ function in ``pandas``.

.. code-block:: python

    pandas.read_csv("prop-committees.csv")

After you run the cell, you should see something like this.

.. image:: /_static/read_csv.png

It is a ``DataFrame`` where ``pandas`` has structured the CSV data into rows and columns, just like Excel or other spreadsheet software might. The advantage offered here is that rather than manipulating the data through a haphazard series of clicks and keypunches we will be gradually grinding down the data using a computer programming script that is 100% transparent and reproducible.

In order to do that, we need to store our ``DataFrame`` so it can be reused in subsequent cells. We can do this by saving in a `"variable" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)>`_, which is a fancy computer programming word for a named shortcut where we save our work as we go.

Go back to your initial cell and change it to this. Then rerun it.

.. code-block:: python

    props = pandas.read_csv("./docs/_static/prop-committees.csv")

After you run it, you shouldn't see anything. That's a good thing. It means our ``DataFrame`` has been saved under the name ``props``, which we can now begin interacting with in the cells that follow. We can do this by calling `"methods" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)>`_ that ``pandas`` has made available to all ``DataFrames``. There are dozens of these that can do all sorts of interesting things. Let's start with some easy ones that analysts
use all the time.

First, to preview the first few rows of the dataset, try the `head <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.head.html>`_ method. Hit the ``+`` button in the toolbar to add a new cell below the first one. Type this in it and hit the run button again.

.. code-block:: python

    props.head()

.. image:: /_static/head.png

To get a look at all of the columns and what type of data they store, add another cell and try `info <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.info.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    props.info()

.. image:: /_static/info.png

Look carefully at those results and you see we have more than 100 links between committees and propositions. That's interesting on its own, but our goal is to focus in on just one: Prop 64.

Quick studies will have already noted the ``prop_name`` column where each committee's affiliation is stored. Let's use pandas to drill down on it. To see its contents separate from the rest of the ``DataFrame``, add its name to the variable following a period. That should list out the whole thing.

.. code-block:: python

    props.prop_name

.. image:: /_static/column.png

One of the many cool tricks built in to ``pandas`` is the ability to total up the frequency of values in a column with the `value_counts <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.value_counts.html>`_ method. We can use it here to total up how many committees were active for each proposition.

.. code-block:: python

    props.prop_name.value_counts()

.. image:: /_static/value_counts.png

You may have noticed that both of the previous methods did not return a clean looking table in the same way as ``head``. It's often hard to anticipate, but in these cases and many others ``pandas`` will sometimes return an ugly `Series <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html>`_ rather than more aesthetically pleasing (and powerful) ``DataFrame``.

If that sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, that's because it is! Like most computer programming tools, ``pandas`` has its own odd quirks that you have to pick up as you go. The difference between a ``Series`` and a ``DataFrame`` is one of those. The key is to not worry about it too much and keep hacking.

In most instances, if you have an ugly series generated by a method like ``value_counts`` and you want to convert it into a ``DataFrame`` you can do so by tacking on the `reset_index <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.reset_index.html>`_ method onto the tail end. Why? Again the answer is "because ``pandas`` says so." So let's play along.

.. code-block:: python

    props.prop_name.value_counts().reset_index()

.. image:: /_static/value_counts_df.png

Now that we've seen all the propositions in the dataset, we're ready to take a crucial step towards our goal by filtering the list down to just those committees that supported or opposed Proposition 64.

We can do that by copying the full name of the proposition that appears in the dataset and inserting it into the following statement, which follows the ``pandas`` system for filtering a ``DataFrame``.

You start with the variable you want to filter, and then create an evaluation by combining a column with an `"operator" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)>`_ like ``==`` or ``>`` or ``<`` with a value to compare the field against.

.. code-block:: python

    props[props.prop_name == 'PROPOSITION 064- MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION. INITIATIVE STATUTE.']

.. image:: /_static/prop_filter.png

Now that we've seen what it outputs, we should save the results of that filter into new variable separate from the full list we imported from the CSV file.

.. code-block:: python

    prop = props[props.prop_name == 'PROPOSITION 064- MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION. INITIATIVE STATUTE.']

The find out how many records are left after the filter, we can use Python's built-in `len <https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#len>`_ function to inspect our new variable.

.. code-block:: python

    len(prop)

.. image:: /_static/prop_len.png

With that we're ready to move on to a related, similar task: Importing all of the individual contributions reported to last year's 17 ballot measures and filtering them down to just those supporting and opposing Proposition 64.

We'll start by downloading `this second CSV file <http://first-python-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/contributions.csv>`_ and saving it to the same directory as this notebook with the name ``contributions.csv``. We'll then open it with ``read_csv`` and save it as a new variable just as we did above.

.. code-block:: python

    contribs = pandas.read_csv("contributions.csv")

.. warning::

    The contributions file you're downloading is an experimental early release from `the California Civic Data Coalition's effort <www.californiacivicdata.org>`_ to streamline the state's jumbled, dirty and disorganized official database. It has not yet been fully verified as accurate by our team and any conclusions you draw from it should be considered as provisional.

    If you want to base a news report off the analysis you do here, you should take the additional step of comparing the numbers you produce against the official data `released by the Secretary of State <http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/>`_.

Just as we did earlier, you can inspect the contents of this new file with the ``head`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    contribs.head()

.. image:: /_static/contribs_head.png

You should also inspect the columns using the ``info`` method. Running these two tricks whenever you open a new file is a good habit to develop so that you can carefully examine the data you're about to work with.

.. code-block:: python

    contribs.info()

.. image:: /_static/contribs_info.png

Our next job is to filter down this list, which includes all disclosed contributions to all proposition campaigns, to just those linked to Proposition 64.

We could try to do this with a filter, as we did above with the committees. But look carefully at the columns listed above in the contribution file's ``info`` output. You will notice that this file contains a field called ``calaccess_committee_id`` that is identical to the one found in the committee CSV.

That's because these two files are drawn from a `"relational database" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database>`_ that tracks a variety of information about campaigns using an array of tables linked by common identifiers. In this case, the unique identifying codes of committees in one table can be expected to match those found in another.

We can therefore safely join the two files using the ``pandas`` `merge <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.merge.html>`_ method. By default this method will return only those rows with ids found in both tables. That means that if we join the full contributions file to our filtered list of Proposition 64 committees, only the contributions to the Proposition 64 committees will remain.

Here's how to do it. It's as simple as passing both variables to ``merge`` and specifying which field we'd like to join with. We will save the result into another new variable.

.. code-block:: python

    merged = pandas.merge(prop, contribs, on="calaccess_committee_id")

That new ``DataFrame`` variable can inspected just as the ones above.

.. code-block:: python

    merged.head()

.. image:: /_static/merged_head.png

After all that we have created a new dataset that includes only contributions supporting and opposing Proposition 64. We're ready to move on from preparing our data to interviewing it.
