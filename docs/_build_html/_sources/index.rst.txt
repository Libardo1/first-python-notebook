=====================
First Python Notebook
=====================

A step-by-step guide to analyzing data with Python and the Jupyter Notebook.

What you will learn
-------------------

This tutorial will guide you through an investigation of money in politics using data from the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/>`_.

You will learn just enough Python to work with the powerful `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_  data analysis library, a popular open-source tool for working with large data files. The course will teach you how to use pandas to read, filter, join, rank, group and aggregate structured data.

You will learn how to record, remix and republish your analysis using the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_, a browser-based app for writing code that is emerging as the standard for sharing reproducible research in the sciences.

And most important: you will see how these tools can increase the speed and veracity of your journalism.
