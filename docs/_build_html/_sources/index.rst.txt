=====================
First Python Notebook
=====================

A step-by-step guide to analyzing data with Python and the Jupyter Notebook.

It was developed by `Ben Welsh <http://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/>`_ for a `Oct. 2, 2016, "watchdog workshop" organized by Investigative Reporters and Editors <http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/2819/2841/>`_
at San Diego State University's school of journalism. It is scheduled to be taught to students at Stanford's Journalism School
and at the annual conference of the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in early 2017.

What you will learn
-------------------

This three-hour tutuorial will guide you through an investigation of money in politics using data from the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/>`_.

You will learn just enough Python to do damage with the powerful `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_  data analysis library, the most popular open-source
library for working with large data files. You will also learn how to record, remix and republish your analysis
using the `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_, a browser-based tool for writing code
that is emerging as the standard for sharing reproducible research in the sciences.

And most important: you will see how these tools can increase the speed and veracity of your journalism.
