Python
~~~~~~

For Apples
^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using Mac OSX, Python version 2.7 is probably already installed and you can test to see what version, if any, is already available by typing the following into your terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -V

You should see something like this after you hit enter:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -V
    Python 2.7.12

If you get an error instead, Mac users should install Python by following `these instructions <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/>`_ offered by The Hitchhikers Guide to Python.

For Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^

Just like Apple users, Windows people should open their command prompt and investigate whether Python is already installed.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -V

You should see something like this after you hit enter:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -V
    Python 2.7.12


If not Windows users can find a similar installation guide `here <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/>`_ which will have you try downloading and installing Python from `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/>`_. After that's done, ensure Python is installed by reopening the command prompt and running the command above again.
