Git
~~~

`Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ is a version control program for saving the changes
you make to files over time. This is useful when you're working on your own,
but quickly becomes essential with large software projects, especially if you work with other developers.

`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ is a website that hosts git code repositories, both public and private. It comes
with many helpful tools for reviewing code and managing projects. It also has some
`extra tricks <http://pages.github.com/>`_ that make it easy to publish web pages, which we will use later.

For this class you will need to have git installed and working from your command prompt.

If you need to install git, you can learn how by following one of these guides for
`Windows <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows>`_,
`Mac <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-mac>`_ and
`Linux <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux>`_ computers. Or you can try to download and install the program directly from its creators' `website <https://git-scm.com/>`_.

After git is installed, you can verify it's working on your command prompt by entering the follow code and hitting the enter key:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git --version

.. note::

    You'll note that the example above begins with a "$". You do not need to type this. It is only a generic symbol
    commonly used by geeks to indicate a piece of code should be run from the command line. On Windows, this prompt could even look quite different, likely starting with a phrase like ``C:\``.

If git is installed and working, you should see something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git --version
    git version 2.9.3
