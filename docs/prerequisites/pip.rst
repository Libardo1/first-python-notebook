The `pip package manager <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ makes it easy to install open-source libraries that expand what you're able to do with Python. Later, we will use it to install everything needed to conduct a data analysis.

Verify pip is installed by typing the following into your command-line interface:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip -V

If you've followed the previous installation instructions for :doc:`Python </prerequisites/python>`, pip should be already installed and ready to go. You can test it out by opening up the command prompt or cygwin and typing in the command above.

If you don't have pip, carefully review the instructional video for Python and make sure you've followed all of the steps. If that doesn't work, try following the official instructions `from pip's creators  <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`_.
