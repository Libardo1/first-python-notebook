pip and virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `pip package manager <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ makes it easy to install open-source libraries that expand what you're able to do with Python. Later, we will use it to install everything needed to create a working web application.

Verify pip is installed with the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip -V

If you don't have it already, you can get pip by following `these instructions <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`_.
