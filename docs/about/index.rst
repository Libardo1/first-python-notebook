This course was first developed by `Ben Welsh <http://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/>`_ for a October 2016, `"watchdog workshop" <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/10/08/first-python-notebook/>`_ organized by Investigative Reporters and Editors at San Diego State University's school of journalism. It was revised for a February 2017 hands-on training of students at Stanford's journalism school and expanded into `a six-hour class <https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2879/>`_ at the annual conference of the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in March 2017.

Ben is the editor of the Data Desk, a team of reporters and programmers in the Los Angeles Times newsroom. He is also a co-founder of the California Civic Data Coalition.

About the data
--------------

The course is based on data provided by the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/>`_, an open-source network of journalists and computer programmers working to ease access to the state's jumbled, dirty and difficult database tracking money in politics.

The state's campaign and lobbying data has been used to develop insightful journalism like:

*  `Campaign cash gives Nunez rich travel style <http://articles.latimes.com/print/2007/oct/05/local/me-nunez5>`_, `Los Angeles Times`, Oct. 5, 2007
* `California speaker gives Assembly's juiciest jobs to biggest fundraiser <http://cironline.org/reports/california-speaker-gives-assemblys-juiciest-jobs-biggest-fundraisers-4501>`_, `Center for Investigative Reporting`, May 15, 2013
* `Prop. 47 puts state at center of a national push for sentencing reform <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-1101-proposition47-20141101-story.html>`_, `Los Angeles Times`, Nov. 1, 2014
* `Connecting the donor dots in California outside spending campaigns <http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article80197182.html>`_, `Sacramento Bee`, May 26, 2016
* `Sacramento's new 'slush funds': Ballot-measure committees <http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/08/20/sacramentos-new-slush-funds-ballot-measure-committees/>`_, `San Jose Mercury News`, Aug. 20, 2016

The goal of the coalition's work is to make the data those reporters used easier to access, understand and analyze. Learn more about the status of the project and the data you can download `here <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/09/15/website-launch/>`_.
